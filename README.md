# Hello guys

This program split any PDF file into desired parts, equally or manually too.

What to Ensure
1. That you have **`Python`** and have installed the **`pypdf`** library with `pip/conda install pypdf` as appropriate.

2. That you have already created the destination folder you want to store your newly split PDF files.

You can also just run the python script *`"General Pdf split.py"`* directly in your Terminal.
